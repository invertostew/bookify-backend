# Bookify (Backend) - Bookings & Appointments Scheduler

## What is Bookify?

This is the backend repository for Bookify. Bookify is an application designed for small businesses to advertise their own services which are assigned to individual calendars, meaning that a company could if they so choose either bundle all services into one calendar, or separate calendars for different types of services.

## Why Bookify?

The idea for Bookify was born because my mum is ALWAYS double booking clients, and though she does manage to always squeeze them in, hopefully now she won't need to!
